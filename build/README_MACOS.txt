Thank you for downloading BrainDock!

FIRST-TIME LAUNCH
-----------------
Since this app is from an independent developer (not the Mac App Store),
macOS will show a security warning the first time you open it.

To open BrainDock:

1. Move BrainDock.app to your Applications folder (recommended)

2. Right-click (or Control-click) on BrainDock.app

3. Select "Open" from the menu

4. A dialog will appear saying the app is from an unidentified developer
   Click "Open" to proceed

5. The app will now open, and you won't see this warning again


ALTERNATIVE METHOD (if the above doesn't work)
----------------------------------------------
1. Try to open BrainDock.app normally (double-click)
2. When blocked, go to System Settings > Privacy & Security
3. Scroll down to find "BrainDock was blocked from use"
4. Click "Open Anyway"


PERMISSIONS
-----------
BrainDock needs access to your camera to monitor your focus.
When prompted, click "OK" to grant camera access.

You can manage this later in:
System Settings > Privacy & Security > Camera


GETTING STARTED
---------------
1. Launch BrainDock
2. Complete payment via Stripe (if first launch)
