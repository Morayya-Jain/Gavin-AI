   (Right-click > Extract All)

2. Open the extracted folder and double-click BrainDock.exe

3. If Windows SmartScreen appears with "Windows protected your PC":
   a. Click "More info"
   b. Click "Run anyway"

4. The app will now open, and you shouldn't see this warning again
   for this installation

TROUBLESHOOTING
